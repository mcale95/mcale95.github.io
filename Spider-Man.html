      Spider-Man is an action-adventure game set in an open world modern-day
      New York City and played from a third-person persepective. It features
      combat systems such as aerial combat, Spider Sense reflexes, and finishing
      moves. Spider-Man can push attacking enemeies off of buildings, though
      Spider-Man does not let them fall, webbing them to the side of the building.
      The player is able to use Spider-Man's abilities such as web slinging
      and wall-crawling as well as other gameplay elements such as the ability
      to traverse using parkour, and the crafting and use of gadgets and
      alternative suits with special powers. Environmental combat, quick time
      events and stealth are also featured in the game. Peter Parker
      (sans costume), Miles Morales, and Mary Jane Watson are also playable
      in certain parts of the game. Peter's sections often involve solving
      puzzles, while Mary Jane's and Miles' segments involve using stelath
      to get to certain positions.
