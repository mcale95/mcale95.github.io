      Set in a "mythic science fiction" world, the game features a multiplayer
      "shared-world" environment with elements of role-playing games, such as
      live events. Players assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's
      last safe city as they wield a power called the Light to protect the Last
      City from different alien races. One of these races, the Cabal, led by
      the warlord Dominus Ghaul, infiltrate the Last City and strips all
      Guardians of their Light. The player sets out on a journey to regain
      their Light and find a way to defeat Ghaul and his Red Legion army and
      take back the Last City.
