      Mass Effect 2 is the second installment of the Mass Effect series and a
      sequel to the original Mass Effect. The game takes place within the
      Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century, where humanity is threatened by
      an insectoid species known as the Collectors. The player assumes the
      role of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who must construct and
      gain the loyalty of a diverse team and stop the enemy in a suicide
      mission. With the use of a completed saved game of its predecessor,
      the player can impact the story of the game in numerous ways.
