      Assassin's Creed Origins is set in Egypt near the end of the Ptolemaic
      period (49-47 BC) and recounts the secret fictional history of real-world
      events. The story follows a Medjay named Bayek, and explores the origins
      of the centuries-long conflict between the Brotherhood of Assassins, who
      fight for peace by promoting liberty, and The Order of the Ancients -
      forerunners to the Templar Order - who desire peace through the forced
      imposition of order.
