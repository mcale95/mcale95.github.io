    <p>
      Played in an open world with a third-person perspective, players control
      protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher, who is
      looking for his missing adopted daughter on the run from the Wild Hunt: an
      otherworldly force determined to capture and use her powers. Players
      battle the games's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with
      NPCs, and complete main-story and side quests to acquire experience points
      and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase
      equipment. Its central story has several endings, determined by the
      player's choices at certain points in the game.
